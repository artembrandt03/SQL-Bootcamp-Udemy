# SQL Udemy Bootcamp
This repository contains my work and notes from the SQL Bootcamp I completed to prepare for my Database 2 class.

### Key Learning Outcomes:
- Writing and understanding complex SQL queries.
- Working with PostgreSQL and PgAdmin.
- Performing data analysis with aggregate functions and GROUP BY.
- Mastering advanced SQL concepts like string operations, comparisons, and logical operators.
- Executing JOIN operations and creating databases with constraints.
- Enhancing SQL skills with Python integration.
- Solving real-world challenges and tasks.

This bootcamp was hands-on, emphasizing practical experience by setting up and restoring databases, tackling challenges, and simulating real-world data scenarios.
Feel free to explore the repository for examples, queries, and notes that reflect my SQL journey!
